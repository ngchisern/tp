### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/SalesNote-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/SalesNote-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `SalesNoteParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a client).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `SalesNoteParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `SalesNoteParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `SalesNote`, which `Person` references. This allows `SalesNote` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `SalesNoteStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.salesnote.commons` package.

## **Implementation - Shawn **

(this division and header is temporary; and is just to demarcate my part of the DG update for this week's requirement)

###`task` and `order` package
This section describes the implementation of the `task` and `order` packages in the application. These two packages are 
similar in functionality to the `person` package, now allowing the user to track tasks and orders. Below is a diagram
showing the partial implementation of these packages in the application:

![`Updated Model Diagram`](images/UpdatedModelClassDiagram.png)

`OrderList` and `TaskList` manage `Order` and `Task` objects, in the same way a `UniquePersonList` manages `Person`
objects, and there are a few significant points about this implementation.

The first is the distinction between the `Person` class, and the `Customer` class. Since every order is made by 
a customer, and the `Person` class is used to track customers, we initially considered linking the two classes, and tying
every `Order` to a `Person`. However, the issue with this is that we did not want deleting of a `Person` to affect 
sales records, which should continue to show all completed orders. We thus decided instead to create the `Customer` 
class which essentially serves as a field for the `Order` class, implementing validity checks for the input, similar to 
how the `Name` field works for the `Person` class.

The next note is that a `UniquePersonList` has a `AddressBook` wrapper that contains other functionalities needed in
the application (e.g. storage related functions). Our Implementation intends to mirror this with a `TaskBook` and 
`OrderBook` wrapper around `TaskList` and `OrderList` respectively, but this was not handled by me, and hence these 
were omitted from the diagram above.

Finally, as mentioned partially above, the `Amount` `Customer` `Date` and `Label` classes are what handle checking the 
validity of fields, similar to the implementation in the associated classes for Person, and also respect a whole-part 
relationship. The validity checking in all cases was implemented using regular expressions, and they respect the
following guarantees:

`Amount` Begins with 1 or more numbers, followed optionally by a block that consists of a '.' followed by 1 or 2 numbers.

`Customer` Blocks of 1 or more alphanumeric characters, separated by at most one space.

`Date` `Label` Nonempty block of alphanumeric characters of length at most 100 characters. We felt this was a reasonable
length for both fields, and would guarantee the UI display worked the way we intended.'

### Addressing feature flaws

A small and related task I addressed was input validation for customers, and adjusting the way we treated equality 
between person objects. The original AB3 treated two people as equal only if their names were spelt exactly the same, 
with this being case-sensitive. When we discussed this as a group, we decided that multiple clients having the exact same name was rare
enough that this notion of equality made sense. However, we felt it should apply regardless of case, i.e. john doe 
should be recognised as the same person as JOHN DOE. I updated the implementation to take care of this, and also changed
the input validation for `Name` to allow at most one space between blocks of characters.

### Implementing commands

Lastly, I implemented several commands related to the `Task` and `Order` classes. These are fairly self-explanatory, 
and their implementation closely mirrors that of similar commands for the `Person` class. The exception is the marktask
and markorder commands, which allow the user to mark tasks and orders as completed. The list of implemented commands
is below:

* addtask
* deletetask
* listtask
* marktask
* markorder




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Display client's total orders feature

#### Implementation

The feature displays the total orders for each client in a new window. Its mechanism is a mix of the mechanisms for `MainWindow` and `HelpWindow`. 

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedSalesNote`. It extends `SalesNote` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `salesNoteStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedSalesNote#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedSalesNote#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedSalesNote#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitSalesNote()`, `Model#undoSalesNote()` and `Model#redoSalesNote()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedSalesNote` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th client in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitSalesNote()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `SalesNoteStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new client. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitSalesNote()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `SalesNoteStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitSalesNote()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `SalesNoteStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the client was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoSalesNote()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial SalesNote state, then there are no previous SalesNote states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoSalesNote()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoSalesNote()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `SalesNoteStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone SalesNote states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoSalesNote()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitSalesNote()`, `Model#undoSalesNote()` or `Model#redoSalesNote()`. Thus, the `SalesNoteStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitSalesNote()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `SalesNoteStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the client being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
